# Deployment Guide - Task Manager App

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- âœ… Node.js and npm installed
- âœ… Git installed and repository initialized
- âœ… GitHub account (for repository hosting)
- âœ… Netlify account (free tier is sufficient)

## Step 1: Build the Project Locally

Test that the production build works:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with optimized production files. Verify there are no build errors.

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

### Create a New Repository on GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon â†’ "New repository"
3. Name it: `csc436-project2-task-manager` (or your preferred name)
4. Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Push Your Local Repository:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/csc436-project2-task-manager.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

### Option A: Netlify CLI (Recommended)

1. Install Netlify CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

2. Login to Netlify:
```bash
netlify login
```

3. Initialize and deploy:
```bash
netlify init
```

Follow the prompts:
- Create & configure a new site
- Choose your team
- Site name: `your-name-task-manager`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

4. Deploy:
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option B: Netlify Web Interface

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "GitHub" and authorize Netlify
4. Select your repository: `csc436-project2-task-manager`
5. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Base directory**: (leave empty)
6. Click "Deploy site"

Your site will be live in 1-2 minutes!

### Option C: Drag and Drop (Quick Method)

1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
3. Drag the `dist` folder onto the page
4. Wait for deployment to complete

**Note**: This method doesn't connect to Git, so you won't get automatic deployments.

## Step 4: Get Your Live URL

After deployment, Netlify assigns a URL like:
```
https://random-name-123456.netlify.app
```

### Customize Your URL (Optional):

1. Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
2. Click "Options" â†’ "Edit site name"
3. Change to something like: `yourname-task-manager`
4. New URL: `https://yourname-task-manager.netlify.app`

## Step 5: Submit Your Project

For your CSC 436 submission on Brightspace, provide:

1. **Live URL**: Your Netlify deployment URL
   - Example: `https://yourname-task-manager.netlify.app`

2. **GitHub Repository URL**: Your public GitHub repo
   - Example: `https://github.com/yourusername/csc436-project2-task-manager`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Netlify

**Issue**: Build command fails with npm errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Try building again
npm run build
```

### Site Shows Blank Page

**Issue**: Deployed site shows blank page or 404

**Solution**: Check that:
- Build directory is set to `dist` (not `build`)
- The `netlify.toml` file includes redirect rules (already included in this project)
- Browser console for errors (check if API URLs need updating)

### Node Version Warnings

**Issue**: Netlify shows Node.js version warnings

**Solution**: Add to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.13.1"
```

### Changes Not Showing

**Issue**: Pushed changes but site hasn't updated

**Solution**:
1. Check Netlify dashboard â†’ Deploys
2. Verify the latest commit is deployed
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Trigger manual deploy if needed

## Automatic Deployments

With GitHub integration, Netlify automatically deploys when you:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push
```

Watch the deployment progress in Netlify dashboard.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain:

1. Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

## Performance Optimization

Your Netlify site automatically includes:
- âœ… Global CDN distribution
- âœ… HTTPS/SSL certificate
- âœ… Automatic asset optimization
- âœ… Gzip compression
- âœ… HTTP/2 support

## Monitoring Your Site

### Netlify Analytics (Optional - Paid):
- Visitor statistics
- Page views
- Performance metrics

### Free Alternatives:
- Google Analytics
- Cloudflare Analytics
- Plausible Analytics

## Environment Variables (If Needed)

If your app needs API keys or environment variables:

1. Go to Site settings â†’ Build & deploy â†’ Environment
2. Click "Edit variables"
3. Add your variables (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY`)
4. Trigger redeploy

**Note**: This project doesn't require environment variables.

## Rollback Instructions

If a deployment breaks your site:

1. Go to Deploys tab
2. Find a working previous deployment
3. Click the three dots â†’ "Publish deploy"
4. Your site reverts to that version

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Test all functionality on the live site
2. âœ… Test on mobile devices
3. âœ… Check browser console for errors
4. âœ… Verify all links work
5. âœ… Share the link with classmates
6. âœ… Submit URLs to Brightspace
